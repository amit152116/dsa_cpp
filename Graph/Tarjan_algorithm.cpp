/*
 * Definition:
 *   Finds all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph using
 * Tarjan's algorithm.
 *
 * Allowed Operations / Rules:
 *   - Graph is directed.
 *   - Traverse nodes using DFS.
 *   - Maintain a stack to track nodes in the current DFS path.
 *   - Each node has a low-link value representing the smallest reachable node
 *      in its DFS subtree.
 *
 * Recurrence Relation / Formula:
 *   - low_link[node] = min(node, min(low_link[child] for each child in DFS tree
 *      if child is on stack))
 *   - A node is the root of an SCC if low_link[node] == node.
 *
 * Edge Cases / Pitfalls:
 *   - Multiple edges between nodes.
 *   - Disconnected graph components.
 *   - Correctly marking nodes as not on stack after popping SCC.
 *
 * Complexity:
 *   - Time: O(V + E) where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.
 *   - Space: O(V) for stack, low_link array, visited flags.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 *   - Detect cycles in directed graphs.
 *   - Identify independent modules in software dependency graphs.
 *   - Analyze strongly connected components in networks or social graphs.
 *
 * Comparison:
 *   - Faster than Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm in practice because it uses a single DFS
 *      pass.
 *   - DFS-based, unlike BFS algorithms which cannot compute SCC directly.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 *   - DFS recursively visits unvisited nodes.
 *   - Use stack to keep track of nodes in the current DFS path.
 *   - Update low-link values based on children and nodes in the stack.
 *   - Increment SCC count when a root node of an SCC is found
 *   (low_link[node] == node).
